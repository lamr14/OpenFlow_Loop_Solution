A POX OpenFlow Loop Solution for Mininet Network Emulations

These are the source code files for the paper "A POX OpenFlow Loop Solution for Mininet Network Emulations" for the MOCAST Conference 2015 by Silvan Streit and Christos Kalialakis.


Abstract of the paper:

Mininet is an open source platform for network emulation. Several network architectures can be implemented and tested in conjunction with an OpenFlow controller. In this work, a solution to the network loop problem is presented by writing in Python a custom component for the POX OpenFlow controller platform. The Google WAN network is used as a test network structure to highlight the proposed implementation.
